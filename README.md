## üìå Project Overview
This project, developed by Farah Elloumi focuses on implementing a DevOps pipeline for PR previews of a React application using Docker, NGINX, DuckDNS, GitHub Actions, and GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

The goal is to automatically deploy the base application and every Pull Request (PR) to a public URL, so that UI changes can be reviewed in real time before merging.

The base application and all PR previews are served behind NGINX acting as a reverse proxy, with routing based on subdomains.

For each open PR, a dedicated container image is built in CI, pushed to GHCR, pulled on the server, and served under a unique subdomain.

The base application is served at ```https://username.duckdns.org```, and all PR previews are routed through NGINX as a reverse proxy using subdomains ```https://pr-number.username.duckdns.org```.

On PR merge or close, the preview container and its NGINX route are automatically cleaned up, and the registry tag is deleted.

### üåü The project must include:

- üîÑ Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

- üì¶ Immutable deployments using container images as the only artifact.

- üåç Public and secure previews accessible over HTTPS.

- üßπ Full lifecycle management (build ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí cleanup).

## üîë Prerequisites
Before using this project, make sure you have the following installed and configured:
1. **Node.js & React**:
- Node.js (v18+ recommended) installed to build the React application.
- npm or yarn for dependency management.

2. **Git**:
- Git installed for version control and to push the React application to the repository.

3. **Docker & GHCR**:
- Docker and Docker Desktop (with WSL for Windows users).
- Docker account (optional if using local registry, required for GHCR).
- GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with permissions to push to GHCR.

4. **DuckDNS**:
- DuckDNS account with a registered subdomain.
- Update your DNS to point to your server‚Äôs public IP.

## üåç DuckDNS Configuration & Port Forwarding
1. Login to DuckDNS
- Go to ```https://www.duckdns.org```.
- Create an account or log in with GitHub / Google / Twitter.
2. Create a DuckDNS Subdomain
- Enter your desired subdomain in the ‚Äúsubdomains‚Äù field: example: ```farahelloumi```.
- Click ‚Äúadd domain‚Äù.
- Your domain will now be: farahelloumi.duckdns.org
3. Verify Your Public IP
- Open a terminal or browser on your server and check your public IP: curl ifconfig.me
- Note the IP address returned (this is your public IP).
4. Configure Port Forwarding on Your Router
To make your server accessible from the internet:
    1. Log in to your router (in my case, Orange Fixbox) by opening a browser and typing your Default Gateway IP address.
          Open  Command Prompt and type: ```ipconfig``` (on windows) and then look for the Default Gateway IP address.
    2. Log in using the username/password on the sticker of your router (username: admin)     
    3. Go to Advanced Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Virtual Server.
    4. Add a new rule:
        - Name: duckdns-http
        - WAN Port: 80-80
        - LAN IP Address: your IPv4 when you tap ipconfig
        - LAN Port: 80-80
        - Protocol: TCP
    5. Add another rule:
        - Name: duckdns-https
        - WAN Port: 443-443
        - LAN IP Address: your IPv4 when you tap ipconfig
        - LAN Port: 443-443
        - Protocol: TCP
    5. Save the settings to apply the configuration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è HTTPS Configuration:
To generate the certificate and key, the following command was likely used:

```plaintext
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/certs
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 \
  -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout /etc/nginx/certs/nginx-selfsigned.key \
  -out /etc/nginx/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
```
- nginx-selfsigned.key ‚Üí private key
- nginx-selfsigned.crt ‚Üí certificate
Then, NGINX is configured to use them:
```
ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/nginx-selfsigned.key;
```

## üîê PAT Configuration:
To allow GitHub Actions to push and pull Docker images from GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), you need to create and configure a Personal Access Token (PAT).
1. **Generate a Personal Access Token**
    1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens
    2. Click ‚ÄúTokens (classic)‚Äù ‚Üí Generate new token (classic).
    3. Select the following scopes:
        - ```write:packages``` ‚Üí required to push images to GHCR.
        - ```read:packages``` ‚Üí required to pull images from GHCR.
        - ```delete:packages``` ‚Üí (optional) required for cleanup workflows.
        - ```repo``` ‚Üí (optional) if you want workflows to also access your repo content.
    4. Click Generate token and copy the token because you won‚Äôt be able to see it again.
2. **Add PAT as a GitHub Secret**
    1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
    2. Navigate to: Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret
    3. Add a new secret:
        - Name: ```GHCR_PAT```
        - Value: paste the PAT you generated.
    4. Click Add secret.
