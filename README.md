## üìå Project Overview
This project, developed by Farah Elloumi focuses on implementing a DevOps pipeline for PR previews of a React application using Docker, NGINX, DuckDNS, GitHub Actions, and GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

The goal is to automatically deploy the base application and every Pull Request (PR) to a public URL, so that UI changes can be reviewed in real time before merging.

The base application and all PR previews are served behind NGINX acting as a reverse proxy, with routing based on subdomains.

For each open PR, a dedicated container image is built in CI, pushed to GHCR, pulled on the server, and served under a unique subdomain.

The base application is served at ```https://username.duckdns.org```, and all PR previews are routed through NGINX as a reverse proxy using subdomains ```https://pr-number.username.duckdns.org```.

On PR merge or close, the preview container and its NGINX route are automatically cleaned up, and the registry tag is deleted.

### üåü The project must include:

- üîÑ Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

- üì¶ Immutable deployments using container images as the only artifact.

- üåç Public and secure previews accessible over HTTPS.

- üßπ Full lifecycle management (build ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí cleanup).

## üîë Prerequisites
Before using this project, make sure you have the following installed and configured:
1. **Node.js & React**:
- Node.js (v18+ recommended) installed to build the React application.
- npm or yarn for dependency management.

2. **Git**:
- Git installed for version control and to push the React application to the repository.

3. **Docker & GHCR**:
- Docker and Docker Desktop (with WSL for Windows users).
- Docker account (optional if using local registry, required for GHCR).
- GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with permissions to push to GHCR.

4. **DuckDNS**:
- DuckDNS account with a registered subdomain.
- Update your DNS to point to your server‚Äôs public IP.

## üåç DuckDNS Configuration and Port Forwarding
1. Login to DuckDNS
- Go to ```https://www.duckdns.org```.
- Create an account or log in with GitHub / Google / Twitter.
2. Create a DuckDNS Subdomain
- Enter your desired subdomain in the ‚Äúsubdomains‚Äù field: example: ```farahelloumi```.
- Click ‚Äúadd domain‚Äù.
- Your domain will now be: farahelloumi.duckdns.org
3. Verify Your Public IP
- Open a terminal or browser on your server and check your public IP: curl ifconfig.me
- Note the IP address returned (this is your public IP).
4. Configure Port Forwarding on Your Router
To make your server accessible from the internet:
    1. Log in to your router (in my case, Orange Fixbox) by opening a browser and typing your Default Gateway IP address.
          Open  Command Prompt and type: ```ipconfig``` (on windows) and then look for the Default Gateway IP address.
    2. Log in using the username/password on the sticker of your router (username: admin)     
    3. Go to Advanced Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Virtual Server.
    4. Add a new rule:
        - Name: duckdns-http
        - WAN Port: 80-80
        - LAN IP Address: your IPv4 when you tap ipconfig
        - LAN Port: 80-80
        - Protocol: TCP
    5. Add another rule:
        - Name: duckdns-https
        - WAN Port: 443-443
        - LAN IP Address: your IPv4 when you tap ipconfig
        - LAN Port: 443-443
        - Protocol: TCP
    5. Save the settings to apply the configuration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è HTTPS Configuration
To enable valid HTTPS using Let‚Äôs Encrypt on your self-hosted runner, follow these steps:
1. Prepare persistent directories
In the repository folder on your server, create two directories to store certificates and the ACME webroot:
```
mkdir -p certs/ certbot-www/
```
- certs/ ‚Üí will hold the Let's Encrypt certificates.
- certbot-www/ ‚Üí will be used as the ACME webroot for domain validation.
***Tip***: Add both directories to .gitignore to prevent them from being pushed to the repository.
2. Comment out SSL in NGINX temporarily
- In ```app/nginx/sites-enabled/base.conf```, comment out the SSL block and any ```return 301 https://$host$request_uri;``` lines.
- This ensures HTTP requests work for the ACME challenge.
3. Start Docker Compose
```
docker compose up -d
```
4. Issue the certificate using Certbot
Run the following command to generate a valid Let's Encrypt certificate:
```
docker run --rm -v letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt -v certbot-www:/var/www/certbot certbot/certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path=/var/www/certbot --email farah.elloumi2000@gmail.com --agree-tos --no-eff-email -d farahelloumi.duckdns.org --non-interactive
```
5. Verify certificate generation
If ```fullchain.pem``` and ```privkey.pem``` are successfully generated, they will be visible in the Certbot container logs.
6. Uncomment SSL in NGINX
- In ```base.conf```, uncomment the SSL block and the ```return 301 https://$host$request_uri; line```.
7. Reload NGINX
```
docker exec nginx-proxy nginx -t
docker exec nginx-proxy nginx -s reload
```
8. Test HTTPS
- Open your browser and visit:
```
https://farahelloumi.duckdns.org
```
Your site should now be secured with a valid Let's Encrypt certificate.

## üîê PAT Configuration
To allow GitHub Actions to push and pull Docker images from GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), you need to create and configure a Personal Access Token (PAT).
1. **Generate a Personal Access Token**
    1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens
    2. Click ‚ÄúTokens (classic)‚Äù ‚Üí Generate new token (classic).
    3. Select the following scopes:
        - ```write:packages``` ‚Üí required to push images to GHCR.
        - ```read:packages``` ‚Üí required to pull images from GHCR.
        - ```delete:packages``` ‚Üí (optional) required for cleanup workflows.
        - ```repo``` ‚Üí (optional) if you want workflows to also access your repo content.
    4. Click Generate token and copy the token because you won‚Äôt be able to see it again.
2. **Add PAT as a GitHub Secret**
    1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
    2. Navigate to: Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret
    3. Add a new secret:
        - Name: ```GHCR_PAT```
        - Value: paste the PAT you generated.
    4. Click Add secret.

## üñ•Ô∏è Setup a Self-Hosted GitHub Runner
1. Prepare your server
- Choose a machine (Linux, Windows, or macOS): in my case Windows.
- Install Docker and any other tools required for your workflows.
- Make sure Git is installed.
2. Add a runner in GitHub
    1. Go to your repository on GitHub: Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Runners ‚Üí New self-hosted runner
    2. Select:
        - OS Window
        - Architecture x64
3. Install the runner
On your server, run the commands provided by GitHub.
```
# Create a folder for the runner
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner  

# Download the runner binary
curl -o actions-runner-linux-x64-2.317.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.317.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.317.0.tar.gz  

# Extract the package
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.317.0.tar.gz 
```
4. Configure the runner
Run the configuration command provided by GitHub (with your repo and token):
```
./config.sh --url https://github.com/<username>/<repo> --token <TOKEN>
```
- ```<TOKEN>``` is generated automatically by GitHub when you add a runner.
- You can also set a label (e.g., ```self-hosted```)
5. Start the runner
For Linux/macOS:
```
./run.sh
```
For Windows (PowerShell or Command Prompt):
```
.\run.cmd
```
You should see in your console that the runner is online.

## üìà Results
After setting up this CI/CD pipeline, the following results were achieved:
1. Automated Deployments
    - Every push to the main branch automatically builds a new Docker image, pushes it to GHCR, and deploys it to the server.
    - The base application is always live at: ```https://farahelloumi.duckdns.org```
2. Pull Request Previews
    - Each Pull Request triggers the creation of a dedicated preview environment.
    - A new Docker container is deployed, and NGINX routes traffic using a subdomain: ```https://pr-<number>.farahelloumi.duckdns.org```
    - This allows testing UI changes in real-time before merging.
3. Cleanup Automation
    - When a PR is closed or merged:
        - The corresponding container is automatically removed.
        - The NGINX route is cleaned up.
        - The related image tag is deleted from GHCR.
4. Secure Access
    - All traffic is routed through NGINX with HTTPS enabled.
    - Public previews can be tested securely from any device.
5. Improved Development Workflow
    - Developers and reviewers can instantly access live previews of PRs.
    - Faster feedback loop and reduced risk of merging breaking UI changes.

## üîß Usage
Follow these steps to use this project on your own server:
1. Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/faraheloumi/pr-preview-project-react-nginx.git
cd pr-preview-project-react-nginx
```
2. Once the repository is set up with a self-hosted GitHub runner, all workflows run automatically. Make sure your runner is online in GitHub Actions before pushing any code.
3. Configure Environment Variables:
- Set your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) as a repository secret (GHCR_PAT).
- Make sure your DuckDNS subdomain points to your server‚Äôs public IP.
4. Push to main Branch:
- The Main Deployment workflow triggers automatically.
- It builds the Docker image, pushes it to GHCR, and deploys the base container react-app-main via the self-hosted runner.
- The application becomes available at: ```https://<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org```
5. Open a Pull Request (PR):
- The PR Preview workflow runs automatically when we have changes in our code.
- A Docker image is built and deployed for the PR under the container react-app-pr-<PR_NUMBER>.
- NGINX routes the preview exclusively to: ```https://pr-<PR_NUMBER>.<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org```.
- The base application at ```https://<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org``` remains unchanged and does not reflect the PR changes.
6. Close a Pull Request (PR):
- The Cleanup workflow runs automatically.
- The preview container is stopped and removed.
- The NGINX route is cleaned up.
- The corresponding Docker image is deleted from GHCR.
7. Merge a Pull Request (PR):
- The base application at ```https://<your-subdomain>.duckdns.org``` is updated to include the merged changes.
- The Cleanup workflow runs automatically.
- The preview container is stopped and removed.
- The NGINX route is cleaned up.
- The corresponding Docker image is deleted from GHCR.
